# Ongoing API Rework
This text is continuously updated to announce or explain changesâ€”whether they're pending, already implemented, or coming soon. It remains a work in progress as we refine and optimize the Exiled API.

## Inheritable `enum`.
In a significant overhaul, we're introducing inheritable enums to replace identifiers. These enums, namely `EnumClass`, `UnmanagedEnumClass`, and `UniqueUnmanagedEnumClass` with the prefixes `EC`, `UE`, and `UU`, act as classes extending the capabilities of regular enums. They offer flexibility by seamlessly integrating with existing enums and accepting unmanaged data types. To ensure uniqueness and prevent conflicts, we've introduced the `UniqueUnmanagedEnumClass`.

## `Pawn` Class
To streamline the Exiled API without custom APIs while supporting these changes, we're introducing a new `Player` derived class named `Pawn`. This class goes beyond the standard `Player` functionalities, offering additional methods and properties tailored for enhanced ease of use and compatibility with custom APIs.

## `GameEntity` Class
The `GameEntity` class, introduced in Exiled API, provides a mechanism to designate certain entities from the underlying game as Exiled game entities. This class seamlessly integrates with the ECS (Exiled Component System), offering native support for all its features. It simplifies the addition and management of ECS components, eliminating the need for static extension methods or static approaches.

## `EBehaviour<T>` Class
The revamped `EBehaviour` class now exists as a generic version, replacing the previous non-generic variant and offering enhanced functionality. This updated class introduces three specialized wrapped versions: `EPlayerBehaviour`, `EItemBehaviour`, and `EPickupBehaviour`. Each wrapped version is meticulously crafted to handle and manage its respective entity type, providing tailored functionality for a seamless integration with custom behaviors. The introduction of the generic version adds versatility and clarity to the overall design, allowing for a more streamlined and efficient utilization of entity-specific behaviors.

## `ItemTracker` Class
The `ItemTracker` is a `StaticActor` and central component for managing and tracking behaviours associated with items and pickups in the game. Let's delve into its logical structure and functionality.

### Event Dispatchers

The class employs dynamic event dispatchers to handle various events triggered during item and pickup interactions. These dispatchers serve as flexible conduits for executing custom logic tied to specific game events.

Item Events:

- `ItemAddedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when an item is added.
- `ItemRemovedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when an item is removed.
- `ItemRestoredDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when an item is restored.
- `ItemTrackingModifiedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when an item's tracking is modified.

Pickup Events:

- `PickupAddedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when a pickup is added.
- `PickupRemovedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when a pickup is removed.
- `PickupRestoredDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when a pickup is restored.
- `PickupTrackingModifiedDispatcher:` Manages delegates fired when a pickup's tracking is modified.

The `ItemTracker` actor acts as a robust system for dynamically handling the complexities of item and pickup interactions in the game, providing a flexible and scalable solution for tracking and managing associated behaviours.
The actor is being actively used for `CustomItem` and `CustomAbility` APIs.

## `NullableObject` Class

The `NullableObject` class is an abstract base class that serves as a foundation for defining nullable objects.

### Implicit Conversion Operator

#### `implicit operator bool(NullableObject @object)`
The class includes an implicit conversion operator that allows instances of the `NullableObject` class to be implicitly converted to a boolean value. This conversion facilitates conditional checks for nullability. If the `NullableObject` instance is not null, the conversion yields `true`; otherwise, it results in `false`.

### How It Works
The `NullableObject` class provides a simple mechanism for representing nullable objects by implementing an implicit conversion to a boolean value. When instances of this class are used in a boolean context (e.g., in conditional statements), the implicit conversion operator checks whether the instance is not null, allowing for concise and expressive nullability checks in code.

This class can be used as a base for other classes that need to convey nullable semantics while leveraging boolean expressions for clarity.

## `ITypeCast` Interface

The `ITypeCast` interface acts as a mechanism for casting objects of a specified type (`T`) to other types in a flexible and safe manner. It provides methods for both unsafe and safe casting, enabling seamless conversion between types.

### Method Details

#### `Cast<TObject>()`
This method unsafely casts the current instance of type `T` to the specified `TObject` type. It assumes that the casting operation is always valid and may lead to runtime exceptions if misused.

#### `Cast<TObject>(out TObject param)`
The safe casting method attempts to cast the current instance of type `T` to the specified `TObject` type. If the casting is successful, it returns `true` and provides the casted object through the `param` parameter. If the casting fails, it returns `false`.

#### `As<TObject>()`
An alias for the `Cast<TObject>()` method, providing a more readable and expressive alternative.

#### `Is<TObject>(out TObject param)`
An alias for the `Cast<TObject>(out TObject param)` method, offering a more intuitive way to express the casting operation.

### How It Works
The `ITypeCast` interface essentially facilitates the casting of objects of type `T` to other types, offering both an unsafe method for situations where the casting is assumed to be valid and a safe method for scenarios where validation is required. It aims to provide a flexible and understandable way to work with type conversions in a generic context.

## `TypeCastMono<T>` Class

The `TypeCastMono<T>` class is an abstract `MonoBehaviour` that implements the `ITypeCast<T>` interface. It serves as a generic mechanism for casting MonoBehaviours to other specified types in a Unity environment.

### How It Works
The `TypeCastMono<T>` class extends `MonoBehaviour` and implements the `ITypeCast<T>` interface. It provides a basic structure for safely and unsafely casting MonoBehaviours to other types in a Unity project. Derived classes can use this as a foundation to enable type casting for specific MonoBehaviours while ensuring flexibility and safety in the casting process.

## Current Structure Evolution
Our existing structure has evolved to accommodate these changes. In the `Legacy` version, we have:
```cs
// Serializable class - Serves as a serializable config class, packing in more values and insights about the custom behavior.
abstract class CustomBehaviour : TypeCastObject<CustomBehaviour>
```
```cs
// Execution class (Gameplay) - Functions as a class with the actual logic, leveraging the ECS (Exiled Component System).
abstract class BehaviourComponent : EBehaviour
```
```cs
// Settings class - Functions as a non-serializable config class, but can be serialized in the CustomBehaviour class. It holds useful values influencing the custom behavior.
class Settings
```
In the `Additive Properties` version, we've introduced:
```cs
// Serializable class - Serves as a serializable config class, packing in more values and insights about the custom behavior.
abstract class CustomBehaviour : TypeCastObject<CustomBehaviour>, IAdditiveBehaviour
```
```cs
// Execution class (Gameplay) - Functions as a class with the actual logic, leveraging the ECS (Exiled Component System).
abstract class BehaviourComponent : EBehaviour, IAdditiveSettings<Settings>
```
```cs
// Settings class - Functions as a non-serializable config class, but can be serialized in the CustomBehaviour class. It holds useful values influencing the custom behavior.
class Settings : IAddittiveProperty
```
Additionally, in the `Additive Properties Collection` version, we've further expanded our structure to:
```cs

// Execution class (Gameplay) - Functions as a class with the actual logic, leveraging the ECS (Exiled Component System).
abstract class BehaviourComponent : EBehaviour, IAdditiveSettingsCollection<Settings>
```

These changes aim to enhance the modularity, flexibility, and overall coherence of the Exiled API, allowing for seamless integration and expansion of custom features.
